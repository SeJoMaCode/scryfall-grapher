## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: "What's my most expensive rarity?"
- X-Axis: **Rarity**
- Y-Axis: **Average Price**
- Chart: **Bar Chart**
- Filter: **Only cards with price**
- Result: See which rarities cost the most on average

### Example 2: "Power distribution in my deck"

- Y-Axis: **Card Count**
- Chart: **Bar Chart**
- Filter: **Only Creatures**
- Result: See how many creatures at each power level

### Example 3: "When were these cards released?"
- X-Axis: **Release Year**
- Y-Axis: **Card Count**
- Chart: **Line Chart**
- Result: See release trends over time

### Example 4: "Set value comparison"
- X-Axis: **Set**
- Y-Axis: **Total Price**
- Chart: **Horizontal Bar**
- Filter: **Only cards with price**
- Result: Compare total value by set

### Example 5: "Price range breakdown"

- Y-Axis: **Card Count**
- Chart: **Bar Chart**
- Filter: **Only cards with price**
- Result: See how many cards in each price bracket

## Smart Features

### Validation & Suggestions

The builder gives you helpful tips:
- ⚠️ "Pie charts work best with fewer categories" (when grouping by Set)
- 💡 "Enable 'Only cards with price' for better results" (for price metrics)
- 💡 "Enable 'Only creatures' for power/toughness analysis"

### Intelligent Sorting

Data is automatically sorted appropriately:
- **CMC/Power/Toughness**: Numeric order (0, 1, 2, 3, 10+)
- **Colors**: WUBRG order
- **Rarity**: Common → Uncommon → Rare → Mythic
- **Year**: Chronological order
- **Others**: By value (descending)

### Edge Case Handling

- **Missing data**: Automatically excluded from calculations
- **Special cards**: Multi-faced cards use front face stats
- **Outliers**: 10+ for CMC, 5+ for power/toughness
- **Empty groups**: Shows zero or hides intelligently
