# Interactive Filtering - Implementation Complete

## What's New

### 1. Interactive Graph Filtering
Click on any element in the graphs to filter and view the cards that match:

**CMC Chart (Bar Chart)**
- Click any bar to see cards with that specific mana value
- Click "10+" to see all cards with CMC ≥ 10
- Example: Click the "3" bar → Shows all 3-CMC cards

**Color Chart (Pie Chart)**
- Click any slice to filter by color category
- White, Blue, Black, Red, Green (monocolor)
- Multicolor (2+ colors)
- Colorless (0 colors)
- Example: Click "Red" → Shows all mono-red cards

**Type Chart (Horizontal Bar)**
- Click any bar to filter by card type
- Creature, Instant, Sorcery, Artifact, Enchantment, etc.
- Example: Click "Creature" → Shows all creature cards

**Rarity Chart (Pie Chart)**
- Click any slice to filter by rarity
- Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic, Special, Bonus
- Example: Click "Mythic" → Shows all mythic rare cards

**Price Chart (Scatter Plot)**
- Click any dot to view that specific card
- Shows single card details and price
- Example: Click a dot → Shows that exact card

### 2. Card List Display

When you click on a graph element, a card list appears below showing:
- **Grid View**: Card images in a responsive grid
- **List View**: Horizontal layout with image + details
- **Sort Options**: Sort by name, mana value, or price
- **Filter Badge**: Shows what you filtered by (e.g., "Mana Value = 3")
- **Clear Button**: Remove the filter to see all charts again

#### Card List Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as you scroll for performance
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift on hover with glow effect
- **Color Indicators**: Visual MTG color symbols (WUBRG)
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### 3. Card Modal (Detail View)

Click any card in the list to see full details:
- **Large Card Image**: High-quality card art
- **Complete Info**: Type, CMC, colors, rarity, set, P/T, defense
- **Price Data**: USD and EUR pricing when available
- **Release Date**: When the card was printed
- **Layout Info**: Shows special layouts (flip, transform, etc.)
- **Scryfall Link**: Opens card on Scryfall for more details

## How to Use

1. **Search**: Enter a Scryfall query (e.g., `t:creature c:red`)
2. **View Graphs**: See distribution across all metrics
3. **Click to Filter**: Click any graph element
4. **Browse Cards**: View filtered cards in grid/list
5. **View Details**: Click a card for full information
6. **Clear Filter**: Click "Clear Filter" to return to graphs

### Example Use Cases

**Find Expensive Cards**

2. Go to Price Chart
3. Click on high-priced dots
4. View expensive modern creatures

**Analyze Mana Curve**

2. Go to CMC Chart
3. Click different bars to see creatures at each CMC
4. Build a mana curve for your deck

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

**`CardList.tsx`** (src/components/)
- Displays filtered cards in grid or list view
- Supports sorting by name, CMC, or price
- Shows filter description and card count
- Responsive layout with CSS Grid

**`CardModal.tsx`** (src/components/)
- Full-screen card detail overlay
- Shows all card information
- Links to Scryfall
- Responsive on mobile

### Updated Components

**`App.tsx`**
- Added `selectedCards` and `filterDescription` state
- Added `handleCardSelection` callback
- Renders CardList when cards are selected

**`GraphContainer.tsx`**
- Passes `onCardSelection` prop to all charts

**All Chart Components** (CMCChart, ColorChart, TypeChart, RarityChart, PriceChart)
- Added `onSelect` prop
- Added click handlers to chart elements
- Filter cards based on clicked element
- Set cursor to pointer on hover

### State Flow

```
User clicks chart element
  ↓
Chart filters cards and calls onSelect(filteredCards, description)
  ↓
GraphContainer forwards to App's handleCardSelection
  ↓
App updates selectedCards and filterDescription state
  ↓
CardList renders with filtered cards
  ↓
User clicks card in list
  ↓
CardModal opens with full card details
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Card images load on-demand
- **Efficient Filtering**: O(n) filtering on card arrays
- **Memoization**: Chart data computed once per render
- **Virtual Scrolling**: (Future) For 1000+ card lists

## Keyboard & Accessibility

- **ESC Key**: Close card modal
- **Click Outside**: Close modal by clicking overlay
- **Tab Navigation**: Navigate through cards and buttons
- **ARIA Labels**: (Future) Screen reader support

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Firefox: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support
- Mobile: ✅ Touch-optimized

## Known Limitations

1. **Scatter Plot Filtering**: Only shows single card (not a range)
2. **No Multi-Select**: Can't select multiple filters at once (future feature)
3. **No URL Persistence**: Filter state not saved in URL (future feature)

## Future Enhancements

See the plan for Phase 2:
- **Custom Graph Builder**: Build your own graphs with configurable axes
- **Multi-Select**: Ctrl+Click to select multiple filters
- **URL State**: Share filtered views via URL
- **Export**: Export filtered card lists to CSV/JSON
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare multiple selections side-by-side

## Testing

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev
